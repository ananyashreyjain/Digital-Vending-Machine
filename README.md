# Digital-Vending-Machine

The aim of DiVe is to solve the problems associated with the currently present model of vending machines. It is often found that the items that are requested, stall out because of its present spring component.
The prototype tends to solve this problem by providing a new mechanism which is expected to work far better and more efficiently compared to the current model.

The project aims to achieve the following:

- Create a Vending machine which accepts all types of digital payments ranging from debit card,credit card, UPI, net-banking and mobile wallets.

- Improve the present dispensing mechanism of the vending machine to make it 100% stuck free.

- Reduce the price of a vending machine that is available in the market by huge margin.

- Make it easy for the businesses operating the vending machines to manage their stocks better as they will get notifications of their product going out of stock.
